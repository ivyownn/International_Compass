        <h1>About International Compass</h1>
        <p>
          International Compass is an outreach ministry of Revival
          International, created to support international students as they
          transition to life in the United States. Our mission is to connect
          students with essential resources, mentorship, and a caring church
          family—helping them settle in smoothly and thrive in a new
          environment. Revival International is one of the denominations under
          the United Denominations – Originating from the Lighthouse Group of
          Churches (UD-OLGC), founded by Bishop Dag Heward-Mills. Based in the
          U.S. with active branches along the East Coast, we are a vibrant,
          youth-driven community committed to sharing the love of Christ through
          service, connection, and compassion. Through International Compass, we
          extend that mission by offering both practical and spiritual support
          to international students. Whether it’s airport pickups, cultural
          guidance, or one-on-one mentoring, our goal is to walk alongside
          students with faith and friendship. We share this vision with our
          sister churches—First Love, Laikos International Church, and the
          American Missionary Church (AMC)—which serve communities across the
          U.S. and Canada, united in our commitment to love, purpose, and
          excellence.
