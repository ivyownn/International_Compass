        <h1>How We Serve</h1>
        <p>
          At International Compass, we’re here to help international students
          feel at home, grow in faith, and build strong support systems during
          their time in the U.S. Below are some of the services we offer:
        </p>

        <h2>✈️ Airport Pickups</h2>
        <p>
          Arriving in a new country can be overwhelming. Let us know your flight
          details and we’ll help make your arrival smooth and welcoming.
        </p>

        <h2>🏠 Church Family Connections</h2>
        <p>
          We help students find a local Revival International or sister church
          near their campus to stay spiritually grounded and make new friends.
        </p>

        <h2>🤝 Mentorship</h2>
        <p>
          Get connected with someone who’s been in your shoes! Our mentors offer
          support with academics, spiritual growth, and adjusting to U.S.
          culture.
        </p>

        <h2>🌎 Cultural Orientation</h2>
        <p>
          Need help understanding how things work here—from opening a bank
          account to understanding public transport? We’re here for that too.
        </p>

        <h2>🚗 Request a Ride to Church</h2>
        <p>
          Need a ride to church on Sunday or a midweek service? We’ve got you
          covered! Just let us know in advance, and someone from our team will
          arrange transportation for you.
          <br />
