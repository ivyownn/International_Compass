          <h1>About International Compass</h1>
          <p>
            International Compass is an outreach ministry of Revival
            International, created to support international students as they
            transition to life in the United States. Our mission is to connect
            students with essential resources, mentorship, and a caring church
            family – helping them settle in smoothly and thrive in a new
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Revival International is one of the denominations under the United
            Denominations – Originating from the Lighthouse Group of Churches
            (UD-OLGC), founded by Bishop Dag Heward-Mills. Based in the U.S.
            with active branches along the East Coast, we are a vibrant,
            youth-driven community committed to sharing the love of Christ
            through service, connection, and compassion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through International Compass, we extend that mission by offering
            both practical and spiritual support to international students.
            Whether it is airport pickups, cultural guidance, or one-on-one
            mentoring, our goal is to walk alongside students with faith and
            friendship. We share this vision with our sister churches — First
            Love, Laikos International Church, and the American Missionary
            Church (AMC) — which serve communities across the U.S. and Canada,
            united in our commitment to love, purpose, and excellence.
          </p>

          <p>
            We focus on spiritual, academic, and cultural needs, helping you
            find a true home away from home.
